After a presentation we visited Wright Park east of Otter Creek. We entered from behind Vermont Soap Works near the end of Industrial Ave, crossed the railroad tracks, and headed north.

In Middlebury we found many Eastern Red-backed Salamanders (~30), a Common Gartersnake (1), and a Pickerel Frog (1). As we headed north down a small drainage we entered New Haven and found Wood Frogs (2), Green Frogs (4), more Eastern Red-backed Salamanders (~5), Eastern Newts (2), a Northern Dusky, and a Spring Peeper (1).

We did not take any photos. There were 11 of us total and we visited for about 2 hours from about 12:00 to 14:00.",NA,NA,"10/8/2021",1,"1053_1"

There were tree roots that were making a tight cage. I didn’t have anything with me (like gloves, for instance...) but I came back the next day to find her/him almost all the way out. With the help of a doubled over fleece blanket and a pair of thick leather gloves, I gave him/her a boost of just a couple of inches (lifting by the back of the shell) so that all four legs were on the flat, and left.

Today, I went back and she/he hasn’t really moved much. Definitely alive since when she/he realized I was close, the head retreated a bit, but she/he hadn’t moved much besides her tail, I think.

JA: photo of C. serpentina, while helping to return this turtle to the water on April 10, 2021, I also found D. fuscus and P. cinereus in the wet drainages between her house (3036 Morgan Horse Farm Road) and the turtle. The turtle was just emerging from its overwintering seep. It was a small muddy seep about 80 meters from Otter Creek. I would have thought the turtle could have overwintered in the creek itself",NA,NA,"4/10/2021",1,"2090_1"

Continuing south the  slopes become smaller. The last that I saw was a wide band of exposed rock not reaching very high up the slope. Surrounding woods contain Red Oak, Bitternut Hickory, Blueberries and other mammal/rodent food. Slopes receive western sun but not much southern sun. I only found the one snake skin.

Incerp from the VTrans Pittsford rail bridge project 2006 report given to Lepore, John:
“There are, however, established and abundant breeding populations of several frog species elsewhere in the mapped wetlands and especially throughout the proposed mitigation parcels adjacent to the work area. Spring peepers, Gray tree frogs, American toads, and Green frogs all have been captured in various habitats around the site. Northern Leopard frogs and Pickerel frogs have also been observed, however less frequently. There may also be a small resident population of Bull frogs and Mink frogs but individuals of these species ha not been captured to confirm their presence. All of these species populations’ are considered secure in the State of Vermont”
I confirmed the presence of Bull frogs later in the season but was not able to confirm the presence of the Pickerel or Mink Frogs. the wet meadow complex on the site supports an amazing number of Gray tree frogs and American Toads. You would not believe the numbers(You probably would actually, but I had never seen so many in such a small area before.) during one of out nighttime visits I was knee deep in a warm pool and counted over 60 toads, all of them singing , within a 5-foot radius of where I was standing? It was almost deafening and the water was churning from their vibrations. ",NA,NA,"5/1/2006",1,"7090_1"

Information from report written by Hertzig, Jeremy Lester and Monique Anderson Lands Small mammal and Herps Survey April- June 1998



The methods used to find herps were
“ Herp records were found by active searching, listening for calls, and the use of minnow traps. Active searching consists of actively looking for species in location where they would most likely be found. This method is extremely affective in finding a large number of species when sufficient habitats….
